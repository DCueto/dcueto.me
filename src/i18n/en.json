My curiosity and initiative led me to a self-taught passion for programming, providing me with great adaptability to new technologies. The training acquired through bootcamps has given me a robust foundation to tackle technical challenges and highlight my skills in analysis and problem-solving. Methodical and focused on developing refined products through testing, with a great emphasis on detail. My previous experience in iOS application development provided me with a comprehensive view of software architecture. I enjoy making team decisions and taking risks if the situation requires it to find better solutions. I am an empathetic person who likes to connect with people. I enjoy working on projects that can positively contribute to people. All this allows me to translate user needs into software."
